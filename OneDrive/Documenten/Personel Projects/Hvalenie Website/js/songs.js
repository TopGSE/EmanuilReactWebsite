		title: "Amazing Grace",
		lyrics: `
		Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
		That saved a wretch like me
		I once was lost, but now I'm found
		Was blind, but now I see.
	
		'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
		And grace my fears relieved
		How precious did that grace appear
		The hour I first believed.
	
		Through many dangers, toils, and snares
		I have already come
		'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
		And grace will lead me home.
	
		The Lord has promised good to me
		His word my hope secures
		He will my shield and portion be
		As long as life endures.
	
		Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail
		And mortal life shall cease
		I shall possess within the veil
		A life of joy and peace.
	
		When we've been there ten thousand years
		Bright shining as the sun
		We've no less days to sing God's praise
		Than when we first begun.`,
